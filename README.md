# jtpotato's GeoFS Scripts

Designed for use through Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey/Violentmonkey.

## GeoFS Autospoilers

Built off of NVB9's Autospoilers bookmarklet. Allows spoilers to be armed before landing. Also sets autopilot speed to 0 on landing.

## GeoFS Tiller Fix

Some aircraft are extremely sensitive to yaw movement when landing with the built-in autoland. This script prevents autopilot from using too much yaw.

## GeoFS Crosshair

A crosshair in the centre of the screen so that you know where the "zero" position is for mouse yoke users.
