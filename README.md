# jtpotato's GeoFS Scripts

**Designed for use through Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey/Violentmonkey.**

## Scripts Included

### GeoFS Autospoilers

- Built off of NVB9's Autospoilers bookmarklet.
- Allows spoilers to be armed before landing.
- Sets autopilot speed to 0 on landing.

### GeoFS Tiller Fix

- Some aircraft are extremely sensitive to yaw movement when landing with the built-in autoland.
- This script prevents autopilot from using too much yaw.

### GeoFS Crosshair

- A crosshair in the centre of the screen helps you know where the "zero" position is for mouse yoke users.

### GeoFS Frame Limiter

- When flying long-haul or doing something else instead of focusing on the GeoFS window, this script limits the framerate to 1fps when the game is not in focus.
- FPS is uncapped otherwise.
